# Hi, I'm Mohsin.

Outside of coding, I spend a lot of time reading. Some of my favorites and recent picks:

- 🚀 **Project Hail Mary** by Andy Weir: The sun is dying and an amnesiac science teacher is the only one who can save it. High-stakes problem solving at its best.
- ⏳ **11/22/63** by Stephen King: A high school teacher finds a portal to 1958 and tries to prevent the JFK assassination.
- 🌌 **Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy**: A comedy about the end of the world, bureaucratic aliens, and the importance of carrying a towel.
